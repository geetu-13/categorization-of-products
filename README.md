# categorization of products


Developed a categorization model in Python to predict product categories based on product names and brands. Utilized scikit-learn for machine learning tasks and pandas for data preprocessing. Trained a OneVsRestClassifier with a Support Vector Machine base classifier to predict multiple categories for products. Leveraged TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction. Demonstrated understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification.
